CODE EXPLANATION:
	
   *Working:
       1. Read the input file
       2. For each requestd book, we check if book is available in the respective tray or not.
       3. If it is available, we simply issue it else we follow respective steps 
       a. For BTech Course:
            i.  Here we implement tray as queue data structure.
	    ii. if tray is full then we remove the first element of the tray (endif)
	    iii.Insert the element at the last of the tray 
       b. For MTech Course:
	    i.  Here we maintain a data structure storing the freqeuncy of each book
	    ii. if tray is full then we remove the element with least frequency (endif)
	    iii.Insert the element at the last of the tray 
       c. For Phd Course:
	    i.  Here we implement tray as queue data structure.
	    ii. if tray is full then we remove the first element of the tray as it will be the one that was least recently used (endif)
	    iii.Insert the element at the last of the tray
